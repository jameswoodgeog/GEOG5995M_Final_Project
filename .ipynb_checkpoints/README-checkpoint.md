The UK recently legislated to become net-zero by 2050, by which time the aim is to end the country's contribution to global warming (CITE). According to the department for transport, around 24% of the UKs total greenhouse gas emissions come from transport, with 99 MtCO$_{2}$e (million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) coming from private transport (CITE). A reduction in this figure would therefore play a major role in reaching the 2050 target of becoming the first major economy to reach net-zero.

The Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) provides Access to Healthy Assets and Hazards (AHAH) data, which contains a multi-domensional index of neiighbourhood health, and includes data on air quality amongst other measures. Air quality data is based on the amount of particulate matter in the air of a size that is 10Âµm (10 microns) or less (pm10).

CDRC also provides data on retail centres, so by looking at the air quality of these, it could provide a starting point in the drive to reach net-zero, and to clean up environments that all of us have a relationship of some kind with, such as those in which we shop.

This work will look at particulate matter around retail centres in the Yorkshire and The Humber region of England.
